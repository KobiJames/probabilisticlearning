# Course Description

The language and logic of probability allows us to coherently and algorithmically account for modelling information and uncertainty.
This course will discuss how to describe, implement, learn from data, and do inference with probabilistic models.
These models let us generate novel images and text, find meaningful latent representations of data, take advantage of large unlabelled datasets, and more.
This course will present the basic building blocks of these models, the techniques required to compose them, and some computational tools we have to realize them.

-   An introduction to probability as a means of representing and reasoning with uncertain knowledge.
-   Qualitative and quantitative specification of probability distributions using graphical models.
-   Algorithms for inference and probabilistic reasoning with probabilistic graphical models.
-   Statistical approaches and algorithms for learning probability models from empirical data.
-   Applications of these models in artificial intelligence and machine learning.

# Assessment


<a id="org0924a8b"></a>

## &ldquo;Will this be on the test?&rdquo;

> The test will measure whether you are an informed, engaged, and productive citizen of the world, and it will take place in schools and bars and hospitals and dorm rooms and in places of worship. You will be tested on first dates, in job interviews, while watching football, and while scrolling through your Twitter feed. The test will judge your ability to think about things other than celebrity marriages, whether you’ll be easily persuaded by empty political rhetoric, and whether you’ll be able to place your life and your community in a broader context. The test will last your entire life, and it will be comprised of the millions of decisions that, when taken together, will make your life yours. And everything, everything, will be on it.
> &#x2013; John Green

<a id="org6aca811"></a>

### Computer Science Communication

For the ComSciCom component, you will produce an original work of scientific communication related to the content of the course through your choice of one or more of the following artifacts:

-   Blog post
-   Technical illustrations
-   Animations
-   Twitter thread
-   Memes

# Policies


<a id="org7878444"></a>

## Due Dates

All assessments are *officially* due by **23:59** on the specified due date.


<a id="orgfaf6d0a"></a>

## Late Submissions

All assessments that are submitted prior to collection will be graded without penalty.
Assessments will be collected no sooner than 48 hours after the due date.
Assessments submitted after collection will not be accepted without special accommodations.


<a id="org97da4d6"></a>

## Special Accommodations

If you find yourself in a situation that requires you to submit your deadline after the due date please contact the instructor email to discuss accommodation.
Be preemptive and inform me as soon as you are aware of any special circumstances that are preventing you from submitting on time. Examples of special circumstances include

-   Physical health
-   Mental health
-   Participation in an academic conference
-   Job / Graduate School Interviews (good luck!)


<a id="org3e8d041"></a>

## Collaboration

After attempting the problems on an individual basis you may discuss and work together on the Assignments with up to 2 classmates.
However, you must write your own solutions including code, mathematical derivations, figures, and written answers.
Explicitly name any collaborators at the top of your submission.


<a id="orgc9d0e74"></a>

## Submission Expectations

Assignments solutions will require a combination of written responses, mathematical derivations, code, output from evaluated code, and figures.
We expect all these elements to be contained in a single pdf writeup included in your submission.
As well you will be expected to submit your code source, though graders will not be expected to run your code to assess your work.


<a id="org023fd63"></a>

## Marking Concerns

Any requests to have work re-evaluated must be made via email up to one week of the date the work was returned.
The request must contain a justification for remark consideration.


<a id="orge4826da"></a>

## Graduate students

Graduate students will be evaluated at the graduate level according to the [University Assessment and Grading Practices Policy](https://governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/secretariat/policies/grading-practices-policy-university-assessment-and-january-1-2020).


<a id="org89d2677"></a>

## Instructor Recording

This course, including your participation, will be recorded on video and will be available to students in the course for viewing remotely and after each session.

Course videos and materials belong to your instructor, the University, and/or other sources depending on the specific facts of each situation, and are protected by copyright.

## Pets

If a pet enters the camera frame during lecture, we will pause our discussion for an introduction to that pet and admiration by all. Dogs, cats, rabbits, hamsters, birds, snakes, iguanas, etc. are all welcome.


<a id="org2e291e3"></a>

## Academic Integrity

You are responsible for knowing the content of the [University of Toronto’s Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters](https://governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/secretariat/policies/code-behaviour-academic-matters-july-1-2019).
